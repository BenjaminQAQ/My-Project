<h4>A traditional college in Tokyo's chiyoda district, yinaikiba college, is facing a crisis of discontinuation because of a sharp drop in enrollment.Nine of them came up with the idea of becoming idols. Once they became idols, the fame of the school would increase and the number of students would increase.In this way, nine girls with distinctive personalities decided to work together to become an idol, hoping to increase the popularity of the idol to save their favorite campus.</h4>
